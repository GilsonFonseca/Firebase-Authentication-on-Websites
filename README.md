# Firebase-Authentication-on-Websites
An example of firebase auth with email in websites
This authentications screens are an example of how we can use the firebase auth to handle user's authentication.</br>
To learn how to do it, you can follow this [guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start).</br>
If you wanna see it working, you can go[here](https://formproject-472d7.firebaseapp.com/index.html). You will see a page to make login
and a button to open a signUp page in both pages after you fill the form and submit it, will open a new page with the user's information.
